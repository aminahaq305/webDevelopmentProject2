      <h1>Four Styles of Photography</h1>
      <h2>Accordion</h2>
      <div id="accordion">
        <h3>Landscape Photography</h3>
        <div>
          <img src="images/landscape.jpg" alt="landscape">
          <p> Whether you're planning on spending the summer at an exotic Euro-Asian location or if you're 
          simply spending it with family in a small town, you can never miss the scenic beauty of the vast 
          landscapes around you. Most beginners fear that if the location they are at isn't instantly appealing 
          to the eye or famously known for its uniqueness, photographing it is a lost cause. However, the reality 
          is quite far from that and as long as you know what you're doing, any scene can be turned into a breathtaking
          landscape. </p>
          <p> The biggest tip that experts give to beginners at landscape photography is to focus on their composition. 
          Most photographs are what you make them out to be and because photographs are visual representations 
          it is important that they are framed in a way that looks mesmerising yet natural. Secondly, you want to pay 
          attention to detail and make sure your images are sharp. Clarity in images can be achieved by using a tripod 
          because it acts as a stabilizer and can help you lock your composition leaving less to be affected by human error. 
          Although most experts day that you should not use your camera's auto mode but I dont exactly agree. 
          If you have enough natural light and you are somewhat comfortable with post production softwares 
          (Lightroom, Fotor, Photoshop) then you should be fine.</p>
          <p> The photograph attached is classified as "Travel Photography" because it is a landscape that I took 
          of a tourist travel destination. The photographed location is Lake Saif-ul-Mulook in Naran, Pakistan. 
          What you see in this photograph is an impulsive decision to photograph an eyecatching scene which has been 
          tweaked to look even more appealing to the eye in post production.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Portrait Photography</h3>
        <div>
          <img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="portrait">
          <p> Every person you meet has a unique story to tell and a unique appearance to personify that story. 
          There are many forums online that can serve as a source of inspiration such as 
          <a href ="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/" target="_blank">Humans of New York</a>. 
          Portrait photography is a rewarding yet challenging style of photography simply because there are many types 
          of portraits, such as professional headshots, editorials, street photography, social media modeling, 
          self portraits, art portraits, and many more. So before taking your photograph decide what style of portrait 
          you are going for. </p>
          <p> Every type of portrait has its own requirements but the most important factor is depth of field and 
          sharpness of subject. Use a relatively wider 
          <a href="https://www.city-academy.com/news/what-is-aperture-in-photography/">aperture</a> but not wide enough 
          to distort the subject. Make sure you have good lighting (natural or artificial) so that you use a lower ISO 
          in order to decrease grain. At the same time there are some photographers who deliberately add grain to their 
          images to get an artsy effect, so I would say that portraiture is what you make it out to be. So, although 
          you'll find all kinds of tips and tricks online to take better portraits, my biggest advice is to expirement 
          and take risks.</p>
          <p> The photograph attached is classified as "Street Photography" simply because this photograph was taken while 
          I was walking through the streets of Lahore, Pakistan and did not direcxt my subject to behave a certain way. 
          This photograph portrays an unadulterated version of the slums of Pakistan. My main focus in the image was the 
          boy himself rather than his surroundings because I wanted to create a feeling of isolation to evoke the thought 
          that this boy is an entity of his own outside of the place he lives in. Like I said, experimentation!</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Event Photography</h3>
        <div>
          <img src="images/event.jpg" alt="event">
          <p> Events are happening special occasions with every moment being an important one to capture. Events can be 
          overwhelming to shoot expecially if you're new to them and have been hired by someone because being able to meet 
          the clients demands and capture everything that they might think was important is near to impossible. With event 
          photography it is very important to focus not only on people but the surroundings and ambience as well because that 
          is what reflects the true spirit of the event.</p>
          <p> Before going, make sure you know the event; know the sequence of events, who is hosting it, and what might be important. 
          It is best to schedule a meeting with the person you've been hired by or if you're doing this for leisure make sure you 
          scout the event grounds so that you're not in for a surprise when you realize you needed artificial light. The biggest 
          advice I would give is to know that you can only be at once place at any given time, and that there is only so much you 
          can do to prevent unexpected situation, so be prepared to go out of your comfort zone.</p>
          <p> The photograph attached is one of the many I took for an engagement ceremony. I chose to highlight this specific one because
          the picture clearly depicts the type of event it was without being too harsh on the eyes. There is attention to detail in the 
          picture and although the dress is heavily embellished your eye goes directly to ring placed on the clean surface of the 
          subject's hands. I used a relatively wider aperture in order to focus on the ring. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Long Exposure Photography</h3>
        <div>
          <img src="images/longexposure.jpg" alt="longexposure">
          <p> This style of photography is usually what my friends tag me in on social media and then ask, "Woah! How do you get this 
          effect in your photos?". The answer is pretty simple; a long exposure! But for beginners understanding long exposure can 
          be quite difficult and there are some roadblocks that you can face while trying to take a long exposure shot. Long exposure 
          shots are definitely one of the more artsy ways of taking photographs and portraying scenery. Long exposure is used to take 
          photos of moving objects (preferably lighted objects), star trails, and light painting.</p>
          <p> While I would encourage every beginner to try to take a long exposure shot of some kind, it is definitely a style of photography 
          that requires a little more familiarity with your camera settings. Starting off make sure you have a tripod that you know 
          how to use, as long exposures can never be taken hand held because of the slow shutter speed used in this technique. You will 
          need to use the manual mode of your camera to manually set the shutter speed to somewhere between 10 to as high as you want. 
          However you would want your ISO and aperture to be low and narrow in order to compensate for the heavy amount of light hitting 
          the sensor. In case you don't have a remote shutter, just set up a three second timer on your camera, frame the shot, release the 
          shutter, move back and let the camera do its thing. Usually your shot will turn on to have some blurriness in some areas or it 
          might be lighter than expected. Fix the former through trial and error, and latter through post production magic!</p>
          <p> The photograph attached is classified as "Light Painting", because at first glance it seems like a painting made with light. 
          This photograph was taken in my backyard on the 4th of July last year. Naturally, I used the key ingredients to take a long 
          exposure shot; a tripod, a remote shutter release, and a long shutter speed. I asked my cousin to draw the number '4' in air 
          with a sparkler while facing towards the camera. After the shot was taken, a lot had to be done in post to ensure that the 
          photograph did not have any background movement and that the color of the light was red as opposed to yellow to go with the
          4th of July theme.</p>
